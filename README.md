Hello! This is the README for our ME35 robotics project. Please remember to create your own branch and work on any changes to code there. I don't anticipate us having to work on the same coding files, but it's useful to keep these around for versioning.

### Vision
The OpenMV cam currently has yet to be tested, but there is currently a program within the Vision folder that should be able to detect the color of an apple and track it.
